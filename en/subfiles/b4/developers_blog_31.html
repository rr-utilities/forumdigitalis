<h3>
    Great idea ðŸ˜„ - that makes for a meta blog post that is both honest and funny. Here's a suggestion for your article:

<h1>
    3.1 AI and coding â€“ a symbiosis?
</h1>
<p>09.08.2025</p>

<h3>
    I am currently writing this article about â€˜AI and codingâ€™. Fun fact: it is being written by AI itself. It may sound like a paradoxical joke at first, but I am serious. Because that is exactly how my website works: the entire technical part â€“ from code and structures to small helper functions â€“ comes from AI.
    <br>
    And yet: the ideas, the concept and the approval are entirely up to me. I define what I want, and I decide when the code is truly â€˜perfectâ€™.
</h3>
<h3>
    What AI brings to coding <br>
        â€¢   Speed: Tasks that used to take hours of reading documentation can now be completed in minutes. <br>
        â€¢	Accuracy (theoretical): AI knows the standards, common patterns and syntax, which means fewer trivial typos occur. <br>
        â€¢	Brainstorming: Often, even a rough idea is enough for AI to come up with suggestions that you might never have considered otherwise.
</h3>
<h3>
    What AI cannot (yet) do when coding <br>
        â€¢	Replacing vision: AI can write code â€“ but it doesn't know why it's being written. <br>
        â€¢	Meeting taste: Whether a button has â€˜enough spaceâ€™ or the layout is â€˜attractiveâ€™ is still up to me. <br>
        â€¢	Taking responsibility: Ultimately, responsibility for functionality, safety and meaning always lies with me, not AI.
</h3>
<h3>
    <strong>My working method</strong> <br>
    For my website (including this blog), it looks like this: <br>
        1.	I have the ideas. <br>
        2.	I tell the AI how I want it. <br>
        3.	It writes the code. <br>
        4.	I review, modify, reject or approve. <br>
    It's almost like teamwork: the AI is the hard-working technician, I'm the architect.
</h3>
<h3>
    Conclusion <br>
    AI and coding are not competitors, but rather complementary. AI can generate, test, and modify code, but creative control remains with humans. And perhaps that is for the best: I can save hours of work on syntax and focus fully on what really matters â€“ ideas and concepts. Incidentally, the fact that this blog post was written by AI makes it even more ironic.

<h3>
    ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to package the article in a nice HTML blog layout so that you can immediately incorporate it into your portal?
